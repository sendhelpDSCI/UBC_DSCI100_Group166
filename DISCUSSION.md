### Summarize what you found
We found that our model was able to predict the diagnosis of heart disease with around 72% accuracy. Although our modelâ€™s accuracy was decently high, It was not able to be higher because a lot of details about the individuals were not known or taken into account. Things such as sex, ethnicity, family history and lifestyle could possibly also play a role in whether or not an individual will develop heart disease, so our model cannot be 100% accurate if theses factors are not considered. 

Through the data analysis, we discovered that ST levels seem to impact the heart disease diagnosis of an individual in Cleveland the most out of all of our predictors. We found that patients with an ST level higher than 3 are almost always going to have heart disease. We also found that patients with a resting blood pressure above 160 mm Hg, or who are older than 55 years old are more likely to be diagnosed with heart disease.


### Discuss whether this is what you expected to find
   We expected that as age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure and ST level increase, so will the prevalence of heart disease. Thus, the presence of heart disease could be predicted by evaluating these health factors. We predicted that all factors would be codependent on each other to help reach a diagnosis. We were right in assuming that age, resting blood pressure and ST levels would play a role in predicting the diagnosis. However, we can see that cholesterol did not really play a role because the distribution trend for patients with heart disease and patients without are similar. 



### Discuss what future questions this could lead to  
Our model was able to help us answer our initial question, but the results that we obtained lead to many new questions, such as:

What are some other factors that can impact the diagnosis of an individual?

How would we factor in the individual experiences or health of a person (such as genes, or family history of heart disease)?

How much impact do the eating habits and lifestyle of an individual have on the diagnosis?

Should preventative measures be taken for high-risk individuals based on these predictors?

How can we reach a higher accuracy?

How would a higher accuracy affect our model?


### Discuss what impact such findings could have

Heart Disease is the leading cause of death for men, women and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States. If the model can predict heart disease with high accuracy it could serve as a tool in the diagnosis of heart disease, and the prevention of some of these deaths.
