    "### Expected outcomes and significance:\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that as age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure and ST depression increases, so will the prevalence of heart disease. So, the presence of a heart disease could be predicted by evaluating these health factors of a patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this outcome is confirmed, this would indicate that people with high relative measures for the four predictors should be aware of the higher risk they have of having a heart disease while those with low relative values for the four different predictors would have low risks of having a heart disease.\n",

    "This could beg questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there other health factors that can predict the presence of heart disease within a patient?\n",
    "\n",
    "Can the predictors used in this model to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient be used to predict the presence of other diseases?\n"
