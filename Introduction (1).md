## Question
What is the diagnosis of heart disease of an individual from Cleveland?

## Introduction
Heart disease is caused by the buildup of cholesterol and other substances on the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This buildup will cause the inside of the arteries to narrow over time which blocks blood flow to the heart and can cause heart attacks or heart failure. Heart disease is thought to be present when the diameter of the arteries have narrowed by more than 50% over time. Some common risk factors for heart disease are high blood pressure, high cholesterol and aging. A common indicator of heart disease is an oldpeak, which is an abnormally low reading on an ECG during the ST segment while exercising relative to when at rest.

We will be using a heart disease dataset from Cleveland that has information on 303 patients and has 14 columns with medical information on the patients. One of the columns is a classification of whether or not heart disease is present in the individual based on how much the diameter of their arteries have narrowed.
