## Question
What is the diagnosis of heart disease of an individual from Cleveland?

## Introduction
Heart disease is caused by the buildup of cholesterol on the artery walls. This causes the inside of the arteries to narrow, which blocks blood flow to the heart. Heart disease is present when the diameter of the arteries have narrowed by more than 50%. Some risk factors for heart disease are high blood pressure, high cholesterol and aging. An indicator of heart disease is low ECG readings during the ST segment while exercising.

We will use a dataset from Cleveland that includes 303 patients and 14 columns with their medical information. One column indicates if heart disease is present.
